# Unofficial-ConneXus-Web
As a current member of ConneXus Percussion and a html/css tryhard, I thought it would be fun to copy, gut, and rebuild the website. Truely some of my best HTML and CSS handy work as well as my first go at attaching JavaScript to a website build. Theres a lot here, and it just keeps growing!

Note: Yes, there is a completed store page. No, I will not post it due to the code actually functioning but only giving you a small t-shirt.
	Visit the actual store if you want merch.

The example page is now live at https://homepages.uc.edu/~delanetw/Unofficial_ConneXus/cnx_home.html
